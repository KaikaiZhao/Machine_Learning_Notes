# Machine_Learning_Notes

This repository contains some useful fundamentals, links, and interesting stories about machinde learning. Meanwhile, it also records the footprints of my machine learning career. My research centers around large scale problems with machine learning algorithms, including deep learning technique. I hope that I could propose more algirithms with rigious theoretical analysis and guarantees. Also, I would like to apply my algorithms into real applications if possible in the future. The most exciting thing is that I am on the way now.
