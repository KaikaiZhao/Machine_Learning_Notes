## Maria Bondesson
The main goals of our Research Lab are to identify toxic chemicals among environmental pollutants and to decipher the mechanisms by which they act. Our ultimate goal is protect humans and wildlife from exposure to toxic chemicals. 

## Katy BÃ¶rner

Katy's research focuses on the development of data analysis and visualization techniques for information access, understanding, and management. She is particularly interested in the study of the structure and evolution of scientific disciplines; the analysis and visualization of online activity; and the development of cyberinfrastructures for large scale scientific collaboration and computation.

We present three-dimensional (3D) acoustic tweezers, which can trap and manipulate single cells and particles along three mutually orthogonal axes of motion by recourse to surface acoustic waves. We use 3D acoustic tweezers to pick up single cells, or entire cell assemblies, and deliver them to desired locations to create two- and three-dimensional cell patterns, or print the cells into complex shapes. This technology is thus shown to offer better performance over prior cell manipulation techniques in terms of both accurate and precise motion in a noninvasive, label-free, and contactless manner. This method offers the potential to accurately print 3D multicellular architectures for applications in bio-manufacturing, tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, neuroscience, and cancer metastasis research.

## Paul Macklin
Our research focuses upon developing cutting-edge computational technologies for use in patient-specific cancer simulators. Our ultimate goal is to create quantitative platforms that integrate patient data from multiple sources (proteomics, histopathology, radiology), to help guide surgical and therapeutic planning.

## Minje Kim

His research focuses on designing machine learning models applied to signal processing (e.g. audio and the other time series data), stressing their computational efficiency in the resource-constrained environments or in the implementations involving large unorganized datasets.
